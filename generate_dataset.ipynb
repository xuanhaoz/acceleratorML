    "My current assumption is that this is still too slow for that option to be viable. However, I have an idea for making the model compatible with NaN's in the input BPM readings--we could add the presence of NaN as a new dimension for each BPM reading, so each reading becomes [x, y, nan_bool]. So, a NaN reading would become [0, 0, 1], potentially allowing the model to learn what NaN's signify and how to deal with them. This would mean we no longer need to check if the inital orbit is closed, and also maybe give us a more powerful model (if it works)."
